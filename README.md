# Graph Search and the 8-puzzle

This repository contains implementations in C++ of graph search algorithms. The are tested by solving different configurations of the 8-puzzle.

The text file with 100 initial states for the 8-puzzle was taken from [here](https://github.com/OhadR/8-puzzle). The last two inputs, which are, allegedly, the hardest initial states (they need 31 moves to solve), were taken from [here](http://w01fe.com/blog/2009/01/the-hardest-eight-puzzle-instances-take-31-moves-to-solve/).
